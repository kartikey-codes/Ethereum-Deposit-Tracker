# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies

# Copy the rest of the code to the container

# Stage 2: Serve the app using a lightweight server like Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port that Nginx will run on
